                                                    A. Integer Sequence Dividing

You are given an integer sequence 1,2,…,n. You have to divide it into two sets A and B in such a way that each element belongs to exactly one set and |sum(A)−sum(B)| is
minimum possible.

The value |x| is the absolute value of x and sum(S) is the sum of elements of the set S.

Input
The first line of the input contains one integer n (1≤n≤2⋅109).

Output
Print one integer — the minimum possible value of |sum(A)−sum(B)| if you divide the initial sequence 1,2,…,n into two sets A and B.

Examples
input
3
output
0
input
5
output
1
input
6
output
1

Note
Some (not all) possible answers to examples:

In the first example you can divide the initial sequence into sets A={1,2} and B={3} so the answer is 0.

In the second example you can divide the initial sequence into sets A={1,3,4} and B={2,5} so the answer is 1.

In the third example you can divide the initial sequence into sets A={1,4,5} and B={2,3,6} so the answer is 1.
